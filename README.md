## About VaxxSafe

VaxxSafe is a COVID-19 Vaccine Registration and Monitoring System. The System can schedule people for COVID-19 Vaccinations, assign them to the vaccination site and raise cases for vaccine side effects. One of the problems that the DOH faces is the single source of truth. Government agencies/municipalities have implemented their System for this pandemic, but the problem lies in data integration. Different LGUs can use this System. They can track their population but also can access records from other LGU for verification purposes. This can be integrated with other (API not yet developed) systems for data entry, registration, and verification.

## Features of VaxxSafe

- Municipality - account will serve as municipality, and population will serve as contacts (vaccine).
- Vaccinee - people who wants to be vaccinated with COVID-19 Vaccine.
